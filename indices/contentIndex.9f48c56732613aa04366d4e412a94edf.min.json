If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain? [Learn how to set it up with Quartz ](notes/custom%20Domain.md).\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n‚ùå [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n---\n\nNow that your Quartz is live, let's figure out how to make Quartz really *yours*!\n\n\u003e Step 6: üé® [Customizing Quartz](notes/config.md)\n\nHaving problems?

A lot of music that I write tends to be tiny scraps, two or three lines. Nothing else ever really seems to stick to them to make them something more, so they stay as little songlets.\n\n\u003e this usually isn't much of a problem, outside of the fact that small songs are very likely to just play in my head on repeat, sometimes for days at a time. I've had a little songlet like this in my head during a v stressful week, and it's one that I dislike.\n\n\u003e It's somewhere around 10 to 15 years old. The lyrics felt adolescent, and so I wanted to abandon the concept, but here it is, stuck to me still. So after 3 days of this, I got up after having gone to bed last night to see if I could figure out how to play it again.\n\n\u003e I played through it twice and on the second time I realized while playing why I hated it so much. So after improvising for a little while, I found the words for why. \n\u003e \n\u003e ended up uploading via youtube because yay technology.\n\u003e [incomplete](https://youtu.be/VhTHpn9Zre0)\n\n\u003e lyrics: (This part is the songlet) incomplete, I know that as a man, I‚Äôm not strong enough I‚Äôm the potter and the clay the artist and the paint I‚Äôve got to make myself a fortress without you and it just doesn‚Äôt fit\n\n\u003e (This part was where improvization started) incomplete, I know that as a man, I‚Äôm not strong enough I‚Äôm the potter and the clay the artist and the paint I‚Äôve got to make myself a fortress without you but it‚Äôs easier to hide\n\u003e \n\u003e it‚Äôs easier to hide to ask it‚Äôs easier to to be small than to take on the task of knowing the places where I can‚Äôt grow without your help\n\n\u003e I've always used music to process what's going on in my own head, but having it happen in real time like that, transmuting something I long detested into something that helped me see more clearly, really was a gift\n\n\u003e Also, waking up today with the joy from that moment and the creeping dread of having promised to share it made for a day with VERY weird emotional topography","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T02:28:10.411772696Z","tags":null},"/notes/recordings":{"title":"recordings","content":"A list of all cataloged recordings.\n\n## Improvisations:\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T02:28:10.411772696Z","tags":null},"/notes/songs":{"title":"songs","content":"## Unorganized Songs\n- [[notes/in the silt|in the silt]]\n- [[stay]]\n- [[incomplete]]\n- [[fire it darling]]\n- it's the simple ways\n- after eleven\n\n## Songs with lyrics and no recordings\n- [excuse me present, i'd like to meet the past and future](notes/excuse%20me%20present,%20i'd%20like%20to%20meet%20the%20past%20and%20future.md)\n- [ductape](notes/ductape.md)\n- [god machine](notes/god%20machine.md)\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T02:28:10.411772696Z","tags":null},"/notes/troubleshooting":{"title":"Troubleshooting and FAQ","content":"\n\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T02:28:10.411772696Z","tags":null}}
