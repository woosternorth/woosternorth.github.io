On July the 6th at 11:36pm, I tweeted:
> Tonight I had a somewhat trsnscendent musical experience, which I think I managed to record. Hoping it worked and that I have the pluck to tweet about it tomorrow

The next afternoon, July 7th at 1:48pm, I replied to myself with:
> I think it worked.

Later at 4:55, I quoted the first tweet and listed the following thread:
> Siccccc typooooooo but anyway, a bit of what happened, the recording will be downthread. A lot of music that I write tends to be tiny scraps, two or three lines. Nothing else ever really seems to stick to them to make them something more, so they stay as little songlets.

> this usually isn't much of a problem, outside of the fact that small songs are very likely to just play in my head on repeat, sometimes for days at a time. I've had a little songlet like this in my head during a v stressful week, and it's one that I dislike.

> It's somewhere around 10 to 15 years old. The lyrics felt adolescent, and so I wanted to abandon the concept, but here it is, stuck to me still. So after 3 days of this, I got up after having gone to bed last night to see if I could figure out how to play it again.

> I played through it twice and on the second time I realized while playing why I hated it so much. So after improvising for a little while, I found the words for why.

> ended up uploading via youtube because yay technology.

> lyrics: (This part is the songlet) incomplete, I know that as a man, I’m not strong enough I’m the potter and the clay the artist and the paint I’ve got to make myself a fortress without you and it just doesn’t fit

> (This part was where improvization started) incomplete, I know that as a man, I’m not strong enough I’m the potter and the clay the artist and the paint I’ve got to make myself a fortress without you but it’s easier to hide
> 
> it’s easier to hide to ask it’s easier to to be small than to take on the task of knowing the places where I can’t grow without your help

> I've always used music to process what's going on in my own head, but having it happen in real time like that, transmuting something I long detested into something that helped me see more clearly, really was a gift

> Also, waking up today with the joy from that moment and the creeping dread of having promised to share it made for a day with VERY weird emotional topography
