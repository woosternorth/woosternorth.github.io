## Lyrics
I'm an old man
inside a young man's body
in that I'm never content 
to let the past stand
my little sandbox of my head 
is so full of things that I could not face
I buried them saying another time, 
another place

will I ever face myself and my conscious?
it clings to me like a leech draining
all my confidence
and making me jaded
toward you
my omniscient god-machine

never thought I could come to you 
without all my ducks in a row
it's so much easier 
to say I don't know
I am shamed
like a dog who went and forgot the door
and I carry it with me forever more
