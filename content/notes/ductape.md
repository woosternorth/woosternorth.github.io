## Lyrics
==chorus==
ductape ain't as sticky
as they'd like you to think
nor strings as strong as advertised
luster won't always remain in lover's eyes
nor intentions stay the same
move along, but not too fast
not all things are meant to last

watch the tendancy to superball
it happened once, so beware the fall
'cause you're more than that

summer days, sunfilled meadows
wind on your face, it's above 
what we see as fate
clear your mind, let the light wash you clean
start anew, even if it means you leave 
everything

==chorus repeats==
break away from your crutch
the walking's hard, but not too much
'cause you're more than that

and I know you don't see how to go on
when your life is left in shambles
but love is love, even rent asunder
so don't break it in your rush

==chorus repeats==
raise your head it's not the end
realize now what's your godsent
'cause you're more than that
