## Lyrics
Did you ever stand above anyone else
As you stand above me now
Or can anyone else, see your colors 
As I see them now
And it's just plain jealous of me
To say only I can see you through
But I just can't bear the thought
That someone else could fulfill you

$$chorus$$
I'll just be content 
With where I stand
I'll remain a bastion
To hold you when you fall
To be above the thrall
I'll be 
Your greatest light

For if the stars malign
Thereby shattering our stone
I know that we won't walk
Through all of our pages
Alone
And I just can't reconcile
All these voices in my head
My labels for relationships
Mean nothing in the realest's bed

$$chorus repeat$$
And when we stand an example, I'll repent 
But forced blindness never helped anyone
Never solved anything for humanity
Or for me

$$final chorus980$$
